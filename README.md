- Used Browsertricx Crawler Chrome browser extension to crawl

- Saved as WARC

- Used https://github.com/webrecorder/web-replay-gen to compile a static hoster of WACZ and deployed on GH pages.

Note: this repo contains the output of the build (_site folder), although I could have just cloned the repo and let the GH Actions take care of the build, it would have been easier and better.
