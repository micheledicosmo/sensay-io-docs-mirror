This mirror was created by:

- Recreate the bump.sh documentation on a personal account (this means that branding and previous history not preserved)

- Used Browsertrix Crawler Chrome browser extension to crawl

- Saved as WARC

- Used https://github.com/webrecorder/web-replay-gen to compile a static hoster of WACZ and deployed on GH pages.

Notes:

This repo contains the output of the build (_site folder) only. If you want CD, clone the repo web-replay-gen and let the GH Actions take care of the build instead.
